CORE REDUX CONCEPT
--------------------
Simple Project to see redux in action without React. 
1. Create center store state.
2. Susbcribe to the store 
3. Add reducer function
4. Dispatch action

The redux revolves around the idea of creating a central state store for managing app wide or cross component wide state. For this we create a store subscribe to the store and dispatch the action.
